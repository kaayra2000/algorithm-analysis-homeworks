## What Does It Include

* findMaxArray

This code is finding the maximum subarray in an array using both brute force and divide and conquer methods. The brute force method goes through every possible subarray in the given array and checks the sum of each subarray, storing the maximum sum and the corresponding subarray indices in an array called "lmom". The divide and conquer method uses recursion to divide the array into smaller subarrays, and finds the maximum subarray sum by comparing the maximum subarray sum in the left half, right half, and the maximum subarray sum that crosses the middle of the array. The function "buyukSayiIndis" compares the values of two integers and returns the larger one. The function "minimum" finds the minimum value in an array. The function "maximum_sum" finds the maximum subarray sum using the divide and conquer method and stores the maximum sum and corresponding subarray indices in the "lmom" array. The main function initializes an array, calls the "findMaxValueBruteForce" and 'maximum_sum' functions, and prints the results using the "printData" function.
